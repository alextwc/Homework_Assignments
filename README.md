# Homework_Assignments
# This repository stored my programming assignments during the period of my PhD student stage.

# "MathematicaHomeworkAssigment.pdf":
# Contains the information of my Mathematica final homework project.

# "C_coding.pdf":
# Contains the codes that I composed to calculate the molecular weight of a given peptide sequence
# generated from our "Mass spectrometry" datasets. These codes were appendixed to my PhD dissertation already.
# There was no available web tools to convert the protein sequence into molecular wiegith when the time I wrote these codes.
# Now you can find a lot of on-line tools to perform such a work today.
